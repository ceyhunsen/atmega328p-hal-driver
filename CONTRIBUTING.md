## Opening PRs and Issues

You can either open an issue to report a bug, suggest a new feature or discuss
another topic before opening a PR. Or, you can directly open a PR to suggest
changes. Opening a PR beforehand might decrease review time but it is not
necessary.

## Formatting

This repository uses [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html)
to format it's code. You can run `make format` to format your code before
committing. Your PR will be checked against the default formatter by CI.
