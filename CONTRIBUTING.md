## Opening PRs and Issues

You can either open an issue to report a bug, suggest a new feature or discuss
another topic. Or, you can directly open a PR without a matching issue to
suggest changes. Opening an issue beforehand might decrease review time but it
is not necessary. Also, issues without PRs are also welcome.

## Formatting

This repository uses [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html)
to format it's code. You can run `make format` to format your code before
committing. Your PR will be checked against the default formatter by CI.
